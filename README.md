## What this is all about

Starting in 2015, [Little Ceasars](https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/) started a modern social media marketing campaign by abusing the old twitter API. They wanted to show people just how much bacon on their pizza is, so they started [Little Ceasars Bacon Timeline (Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160303113703/http://www.littlecaesarsbacontimeline.com/), where you could automatically send one tweet for each inch of bacon their pizza has (it has 42 inches).

Although many people hated it, people loved to troll their follower (especially back then) and overall it was a successful guerilla marketing campaign.

For every poor soul who wasn't active on twitter in 2015 we recreated the experience, [see what you missed!](https://t.me/bacon_timeline_bot)
